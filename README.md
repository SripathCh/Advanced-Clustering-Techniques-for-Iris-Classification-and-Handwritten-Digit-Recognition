# Iris K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project is dedicated to implementing the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch. The implementation is tested on the well-known Iris dataset in part one, and it's further extended to cluster processed vector data of 10,000 images of handwritten digits (from zero to nine) in part two.

## Repository Contents
- `kMeansIrisPartOne.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating K-means clustering on the Iris dataset.
- `kMeansIrisPartTwo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook applying the K-means algorithm to cluster images of handwritten digits.

## Objectives
- **Part One:** Develop and validate K-means clustering on the Iris dataset.
- **Part Two:** Extend the K-means algorithm to handle and predict clusters of image data, specifically handwritten digits.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
